### Hi there 👋

Starting out with ZX Spectrum and Sinclair BASIC at the age of 10 I never stopped learning new programming skills and languages. Early I started creating programs, and websites for friends and just for fun as well. It was a time when IE 6 and Netscape Navigator were the most popular browsers, and Firefox and Chrome didn't exist yet.

It was a magical time when the necessary codes could only be learned from books and magazines, and tapes changed hands. This passion has since lasted and lead to my decision of working as a software developer and consultant. The success and fun I have in this job is immense and really keeps that passion burningly alive.

Starting web development on the backend (Ruby with Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, Golang, Java) I also became more and more of a frontend developer using modern frameworks like Backbone, Knockout, React, Angular or VueJS in a lot of projects. I love both worlds nowadays!
